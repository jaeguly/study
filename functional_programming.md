**Functional Programming**
* In a restricted sense, functional programming means programming without mutable variables, assignments, loops, and other imperative control structures.
* In a wider sense, functional programming means focusing on the functions.
* In particular, functions can be values that are produced, consumed, and composed.
* All becomes easier in a functional language.
* In particular, functions in a FP language are first-class citizens. This means
  * they can be defined anywhere, including inside other functions
  * like any other value, they can be passed as parameters to functions and returned as results
  * as for other values, there exists a set operators to compose functions
